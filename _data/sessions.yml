  title: "Dynamic Network Perspective of Cryptocurrencies"
  description: "Authors: Li Guo, Yubo Tao and Wolfgang K. Härdle<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  Cryptocurrencies are becoming an attractive asset class and are the focus of recent
  quantitative research. The joint dynamics of the cryptocurrency market yields information on network risk.
  Utilizing the adaptive LASSO approach, we build a dynamic network of cryptocurrencies and model the latent
  communities with a dynamic stochastic blockmodel. We develop a dynamic covariate-assisted spectral
  clustering method to uniformly estimate the latent group membership of cryptocurrencies consistently.
  We show that return inter-predictability and crypto characteristics, including hashing algorithms
  and proof types, jointly determine the crypto market segmentation. Based on this classification result,
  it is natural to employ eigenvector centrality to identify a cryptocurrency’s idiosyncratic risk.
  n asset pricing analysis finds that a cross-sectional portfolio with a higher centrality earns a
  higher risk premium. Further tests confirm that centrality serves as a risk factor well and delivers
  valuable information content on cryptocurrency markets.</p>"

  title: "Using generalized estimating equations to estimate nonlinear models with spatial data"
  description: "Authors: Cuicui Lu, Weining Wang, Jeffrey M. Wooldridge<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  We study estimation of nonlinear models with cross sectional data using two-step generalized
  estimating equations (GEE) in the quasi-maximum likelihood estimation (QMLE) framework. In the interest of
  improving efficiency, we propose a grouping estimator to account for the potential spatial correlation in
  the underlying innovations for count data and binary response data. Under mild weak dependency assumptions,
  results on estimation consistency and asymptotic normality are provided. Monte Carlo simulations show
  efficiency gain of our approach in comparison of different estimation methods. Finally we apply the GEE
  approach to study the determinants of the inflow foreign direct investment (FDI) to China.</p>"

  title: "Cross-border Lending Network and Systemic Risk Across Global Stock Markets"
  description: "Authors: Yongshi Jie and Yinggang Zhou<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  This paper examines whether systemic risk of cross-border lending network can propagate to
  risk spillover network of global stock market. We find that the stock market risk spillover network is more
  stable (fragile) if the cross-border lending network becomes more diversified when the shock is small (big)
   enough. Moreover, the higher the ratio of cross-border lending to the GDP of the countries which borrow,
   the bigger impact of risk spillover on the countries which lend more. Finally, the exponential random graph
   model (ERGM) is used to interpret the relationship between two networks. The connections in cross-border
   lending network have a significantly positive on the likelihood of spillover effect relations in global
   stock market.</p>"

  title: "Micro Forecasting"
  description: 'Authors: Matus Maciak, Ostap Okhrin, Michal Pesta<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  Forecasting costs is now a front burner in empirical economics. We propose an unconventional tool for stochastic
  prediction of future expenses based on individual (micro) developments of recorded events. Let us think of a firm, enterprise,
  institution, or state, which possesses knowledge about particular historical events. For each event, there are several related
  payments or losses spread over time. Nevertheless, the issue is that some already occurred events do not have to be necessarily
  reported. The aim lies in forecasting future cash flows coming from already reported, occurred but not reported, and yet not occurred
  events. Our methodology is illustrated on quantitative risk assessment, however, it can be applied to other areas such as startups,
  epidemics, war damages, advertising and commercials, credit cards, or prescription behavior of general practitioners as discussed in
  the paper. As a theoretical contribution, stochastic inference for marked non-homogeneous Poisson process with non homogeneous Poisson
  processes as marks is developed.</p>'

  title: "RatingBot: A Text Mining Based Rating Approach"
  ##### WANTS TO PRESENT SEP 30 MONDAY !!!!
  description: 'Authors: Diana Hristova<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  Credit risk is at the core of banking business and its adequate measurement is crucial for financial institutions.
  Due to lack of historical default data and heterogeneity of customers, qualitative expert-based information
  is an important factor in measuring the creditworthiness of large companies. However, such information is
  often extracted manually, causing inefficiencies and possible subjectivity. The RatingBot is a text mining
  based rating approach, which efficiently and objectively models relevant qualitative information based
  on annual reports. It combines both the literature on text mining in finance and machine learning in c
  redit rating to derive the credit rating of a company. The approach is evaluated on two datasets:
  a publicly available one that facilitates replicability, and a dataset provided by a major
  European bank representing real-world scenario. The results show that RatingBot delivers additional
  predictive power and should be considered in future research on credit rating models.</p>'

  title: "Rating Ordinality in ML Based Credit Models"
  description: "Authors: Steffen Thesdorf<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  The credit rating as a measure of a company's ability to pay back its liabilities is a crucial information source, e.g. for bond investors. There have been numerous attempts to
  reproduce credit ratings by objective models, that is without any (presumably costly) expert judgment. A comprehensive literature review of studies on corporate credit rating models reveals that a wide
  range of flexible machine learning models are applied to the credit rating domain which however usually neglect the rating ordinality. The objective of present study is to find an answer to the
  question whether the consideration of the order information improves the prediction performance of the rating models. The Ordinal Pairwise Partitioning (OPP) approach is shown to be a straightforward
  enhancement to allow a nominal classification model to account for output ordinality. The nominal classification versions of the machine learning models are hence compared with their OPP counterparts
  by applying all models to a Deutsche Bank dataset. The results are ambiguous. Whereas Ordered Partitions (OP), as one variant of OPP, proves to promote the prediction accuracy, the OPP variants
  One-vs-Followers (OVF) and One-vs-Next (OVN) yield inferior outcomes.</p>"

  title: "Testing for neglected nonlinearity in the conditional quantile using neural networks"
  description: "Authors: Georg Keilbar, Weining Wang<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  Neural networks have proved to achieve tremendous success in a large number of prediction problems.
  Unfortunately, this success comes at the expense of imposing challenges for the interpretation of models and for
  conducting inference in general. In this paper, we propose a test for neglected nonlinearity in the conditional
  quantile by comparing the fit of a linear model to an alternative model constructed as a neural network series
  estimator. The problem can be formulated as a significance test of the output weight parameters of the neural
  network in the presence of nuisance parameters under the alternative. We provide consistency and asymptotic
  normality of the neural network series estimator. We propose three test statistics as functions of a Wald
  process depending on the nuisance parameters the average, the exponential average and the supremum Wald
  statistic. Critical values can be simulated. Simulations show that our test has proper size and good power.
  An application to analysis of systemic risk in a financial network indicates an important role of neglected
  nonlinearity.</p>"

  title: "Heterogeneous Treatment Effects through Teaching Activity on Satisfaction for Intellectual Challenge"
  description: "Authors: Daniel Jacob<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  Scientists who give lectures or seminars might be more prone to developing new ideas for their research through the interaction with students during their teaching activities. In this paper, I estimate heterogeneous treatment effects of teaching on the perceived degree of intellectual challenge of scientists using data from the National Science Foundation (NSF). To provide as much information about the causal effects as possible and also to control for a potential selection-bias, I expand the idea of making inference on key features of heterogeneous effects sorted by impact groups (GATES), to non-randomised experiments. This is achieved through the implementation of a doubly-robust estimator. Cross-splitting with multiple iter- ations is a further extension to avoid biases introduced through sample splitting. The advantage of the proposed method is the robust estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects which is comparable with other models and thus keeps its flexibility in the choice of machine learning methods and at the same time its ability to deliver interpretable results. The empirical findings support the hypothesis that teaching activities, conducted by scientists, have a causal effect on the satisfaction with the job’s intellectual challenge. The difference in the satisfaction (scaled from 1 for very dissatisfied to 4 for very satisfied) is 0.14 between the most and least affected scientists. I conduct a classification analysis to provide insight into the average values of such key features, again for the most and least affected. Finally, I estimate the conditional average treatment effect for each individual, which allows making predic- tions of the treatment effect for new scientists. I find that there is heterogeneity in the treatment effect which is positive for the majority and negative for some scientists.</p>"

  title: "Uniform Inference in High-dimensional Gaussian Graphical Models"
  description: "Authors: Sven Klaassen, Jannis Kueck, Martin Spindler and Victor Chernozhukov<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  Graphical models have become a very popular tool for representing dependencies within a
  large set of variables and are key for representing causal structures. We provide results for uniform
  inference on high-dimensional graphical models with the number of target parameters d being
  possible much larger than sample size. This is in particular important when certain features or
  structures of a causal model should be recovered. Our results highlight how in high- dimensional
  settings graphical models can be estimated and recovered with modern machine learning methods in
  complex data sets. To con- struct simultaneous confidence regions on many target parameters, sufficiently
  fast estimation rates of the nuisance functions are crucial. In this context, we establish uniform
  estimation rates and sparsity guarantees of the square-root estimator in a random design under
  approximate sparsity conditions that might be of independent inter- est for related problems in
  high-dimensions. We also demonstrate in a comprehensive simulation study that our procedure has
  good small sample properties.</p>"
