  title: "Micro Forecasting"
  description: 'Authors: Matus Maciak, Ostap Okhrin, Michal Pesta<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  Forecasting costs is now a front burner in empirical economics. We propose an unconventional tool for stochastic
  prediction of future expenses based on individual (micro) developments of recorded events. Let us think of a firm, enterprise,
  institution, or state, which possesses knowledge about particular historical events. For each event, there are several related
  payments or losses spread over time. Nevertheless, the issue is that some already occurred events do not have to be necessarily
  reported. The aim lies in forecasting future cash flows coming from already reported, occurred but not reported, and yet not occurred
  events. Our methodology is illustrated on quantitative risk assessment, however, it can be applied to other areas such as startups,
  epidemics, war damages, advertising and commercials, credit cards, or prescription behavior of general practitioners as discussed in
  the paper. As a theoretical contribution, stochastic inference for marked non-homogeneous Poisson process with non homogeneous Poisson
  processes as marks is developed.</p>'
